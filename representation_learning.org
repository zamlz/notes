* What is it?
A paradigm of [[id:e22e7039-4545-4ae6-bab2-794b98b6651a][Machine Learning]] that focuses on learning representations of data.
*Representation Learning*'s goal is to essentially learn simpler features from data that have meaning.
These features/representations can be used to make/solve complex decisions/problems.

* Example
Suppose you have a dataset of dogs and cats and you wish to distinguish them. A *Representation Learning* algorithm would learn simple features which may answer simpler questions like /"is there a paw?"/, /"does it have pointy ears?"/, etc. These simpler features can be used then make the decision of whether the picture is a dog or a cat.
