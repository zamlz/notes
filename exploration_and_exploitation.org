A fundamental problem in [[file:reinforcement_learning.org][Reinforcement Learning]] is whether to leverage exploration in order to find new strategies or states with better [[file:reward_signal.org][Reward]], or to exploit existing knowledge of strategies and states to get existing [[file:reward_signal.org][Reward Signal]]. How do we leverage new and existing experiences to safely explore the environment in order to gain new (better) reward?
