Fully Observable Environments are [[file:rl_environment.org][Environment]]s where the [[file:rl_agent.org][Agent]] is able to fully see the internal environment state /(everything)/. Formally,

\[O_t = S^a_t = S^e_t\]

As every state is a [[file:markov_state.org][Markov State]], a Fully Observable Environment is a Markov Decision Process.
