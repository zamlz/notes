Fully Observable Environments are [[id:9e3eca4d-4109-46f9-8632-45c02dcead4e][Environment]]s where the [[id:3d770134-2e93-4397-a846-227e71f2fe31][Agent]] is able to fully see the internal environment state /(everything)/. Formally,

\[O_t = S^a_t = S^e_t\]

As every state is a [[id:16356f25-0524-4786-9846-c05f3dac8d8e][Markov State]], a Fully Observable Environment is a Markov Decision Process.
