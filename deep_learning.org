* What is it?
Deep Learning is a form of [[file:representation_learning.org][Representation Learning]] that focuses on using Neural Networks to learn heirarchical representations /(via hidden layers of the neural network)/ to make predictions on the data. It solves one of the typical problems with [[file:representation_learning.org][Representation Learning]], /"Which representations should be learn about our data?"/
