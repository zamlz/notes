* What is it?
Deep Learning is a form of [[id:5f6a5c06-9499-46bc-89e0-4b6c03aa14fc][Representation Learning]] that focuses on using Neural Networks to learn heirarchical representations /(via hidden layers of the neural network)/ to make predictions on the data. It solves one of the typical problems with [[id:5f6a5c06-9499-46bc-89e0-4b6c03aa14fc][Representation Learning]], /"Which representations should be learn about our data?"/
