An environment model is a model that predicts what an [[id:9e3eca4d-4109-46f9-8632-45c02dcead4e][RL Environment]] will do next. As we deal with [[id:26dba5c1-4cf0-42d0-9b33-8fcdfd7c34af][Markov Decision Process]]es, we can model the dynamics of the environment my learning the state transitions and reward function. These are formally defined below.

\[P^a_{ss'} = \mathbb{P}[S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = a, A_t = a]\]

\[R^a_s = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} | S_t = s, A_t = a]\]
