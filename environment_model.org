An environment model is a model that predicts what an [[file:rl_environment.org][RL Environment]] will do next. As we deal with [[file:markov_decision_process.org][Markov Decision Process]]es, we can model the dynamics of the environment my learning the state transitions and reward function. These are formally defined below.

\[P^a_{ss'} = \mathbb{P}[S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = a, A_t = a]\]

\[R^a_s = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} | S_t = s, A_t = a]\]
