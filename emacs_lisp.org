Elisp is a dialect of the [[file:lisp_programming_language.org][Lisp Programming Language]] that is used to create the integrated environment of [[file:../config/emacs.org][GNU/Emacs]]. It is a fully fledged programming language and is desgined to make the editor extensible to any degree.

** Understanding the difference between ~(list ...)~, ~`~, and ~'~
The following methods are similar but will produce slightly different results. When you use ~(list a b c)~, elisp will try to resolve the values of ~a~, ~b~, and ~c~. Instead if you want these to be symbols, you must prefix them with the ~'~. Here is quick example that covers all the different uses.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(list (+ 1 2) (concat "3" "4")) => (3 "34")

(list '(+ 1 2) '(concat "3" "4")) => ((+ 1 2) (concat "3" "4"))

'((+ 1 2) (concat "3" "4")) => ((+ 1 2) (concat "3" "4"))

`((+ 1 2) ,(concat "3" "4")) => ((+ 1 2) "34")
#+end_src
